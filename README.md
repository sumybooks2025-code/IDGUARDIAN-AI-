## 💡 Extended Description  

**IDGuardian AI** is an innovative digital identity and security platform built on **Hedera Hashgraph** and enhanced with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
It empowers individuals and organizations to create, verify, and manage **self-sovereign digital identities (SSIDs)** securely — without exposing sensitive personal data.

The platform solves one of the most pressing challenges of the digital era: **trust and privacy in identity verification**. Traditional ID systems are centralized, vulnerable to data breaches, and often exclude users without access to formal credentials. IDGuardian AI bridges this gap by offering a decentralized, user-controlled, and AI-verified identity solution designed for inclusivity, transparency, and security.

## ⚙️ Core Innovation  

1. **Hedera-Backed Decentralization:**  
   Utilizes the Hedera Testnet SDK to securely anchor digital ID hashes, ensuring transparency, immutability, and tamper-proof record keeping.

2. **AI-Enhanced Verification Engine:**  
   Integrates AI for real-time facial, document, and liveness verification — ensuring identity authenticity without storing raw biometric data.

3. **Privacy-Preserving Architecture:**  
   Implements **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) principles** to allow users to prove identity ownership or eligibility without revealing private information.

4. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):**  
   Users fully control their credentials, choosing what information to share, when, and with whom.

5. **Simulation Mode (MVP):**  
   The current build runs in simulation mode using the **Hedera Testnet SDK** for safe testing, showcasing all core logic flows (registration, credential issuance, verification, and sharing).
